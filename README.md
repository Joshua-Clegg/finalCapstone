### Section 1 - Introduction
This Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was made on a US Arrests dataset in order to measure the magnitude of certain crimes in the 50 US states.
PCA is used in order to reduce the amount of variables that share the same difference in a dataset by encoding the data into fewer dimensions.
PCA is a form of Unsupervised Machine Learning i.e., mostly autonomous. Clustering techniques such as K-Mean and Hierarchical Clustering was used in order to further validate key observations.
This repository contains the jupyter notebook file used to compile the data as well as the documented pdf file with the explanation of the PCA Analysis.
